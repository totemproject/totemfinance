**Totem NFT** is a new technology reducing frictions of smart-contracts interaction using Non-fungible Tokens as a core. We redefine the concepts of main DeFi components (like farming, lending, borrowing).

*“All you need to get rewards is to be owner of one of the TOTEM. That’s it.”*

There are two kinds of tokens in Totem ecosystem: TEM (fungible ERC20 tokens, Max supply: 4,316,539 TEM) and TOTEM (Non-fungible tokens, Max supply 100 TOTEM). The system works by applying a 1% fee for each TEM transaction and splitting this commission among all current TOTEM NFT owners instantly.


### TEM tokens distribution:

* Max supply: 4,316,539 TEM
* LGE allocation **Burned**: 1,305,012 TEM
* Sushiswap liquidity: 1,305,012 TEM
* Smart pool (blocked liquidity for lending to TOTEM owners): 1,305,012 TEM
* Marketing, team: 401,503 TEM

### TOTEM NFT distribution:

Max supply 100 TOTEM

### TOTEM smart rules:

* 🔑 Only 100 TOTEM will be released ever;
* 🔑 Each TOTEM will be offered for sale through decentralized auctions, one by one;
* 🔑 Only TEM tokens accepted to buy TOTEM during the auction;
* 🔑 All TEM tokens used in auctions will be burned;
* 🔑 Each TOTEM auction lasts for two days. If there are no one bids during the auction, it will be extended until the first bid placed;
* 🔑 Min. auction price for the first TOTEM is 5000 TEM. Min. price for each next TOTEM will be on 244 TEM more expensive than the previous one;
* 🔑 To get TEM rewards you must be an owner of one of the TOTEM. All TOTEM owners receive an equal share of the total reward. If you have more than one TOTEM, you will receive the same part of the reward as the owner of one TOTEM. More TOTEMs do not mean more rewards;
* 🔑 After the 50th TOTEM will be distributed through auction, Smart pool for Lending and Borrowing will be launched.
